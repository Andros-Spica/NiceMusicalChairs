# NiceMusicalChairs

The NMC model, a sequel of the Musical Chairs model, allows exploring how land use competition may be constrained by social structure and dynamics, according to which individual stakeholders compete and cooperate depending on adscription to social groups. 
The NMC model also enables to test the effects of two particular modalities of cooperative mechanisms: land use pairing, the awarding, in terms of productivity, of any direct collaboration between farming and herding within a group; and group management, the prerogative of a group leadership to manage individual stakeholders in order to pursue a particular proportion between farming and herding. Lastly, the model allows assessing the effects of these mechanisms under either open or restricted access to pasture regimes.
